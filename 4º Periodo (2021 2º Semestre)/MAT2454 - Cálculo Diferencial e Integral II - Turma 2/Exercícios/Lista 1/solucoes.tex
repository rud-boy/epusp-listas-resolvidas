Utilizando o polinômio de Taylor de ordem 2, calcule um valor aproximado e
avalie o erro.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  f'''(x)
  &= - \frac{2}{9} \cdot \frac{-5x^{-\frac{8}{3}}}{3}

  f''(8)

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  P_2(8,2)

  &= \frac{10}{27 \cdot 2^8} \cdot \frac{2^3}{10^3 \cdot 6}
